# Vital Carousel Component

The Vital Carousel Component can present a collection of a variety of components to your users as a
sequential slideshow. An image is the simplest (and default) example of a component that can be
displayed within a Vital Carousel, but Site Builders are able to provide Content Editors with other,
more complex components — like Linkable Images, Videos, and Cards.

## Component Variations

Using the [tokens provided in the Vital Carousel
package](../../Development/API/@bodiless/vital-carousel/README), a Site Builder can construct a
number of Carousel variations to meet your site's needs. Showcased below are a few examples:

### Horizontal Cards

![Product Card Horizontal Carousel](./assets/ProductCardHorizontal.jpg)

This Carousel displays a horizontal lineup of [Cards](./VitalCard/), with a horizontal scrollbar to
handle any overflow.

A great use case for a Carousel like this would be for Product Cards in a "Bestselling Products"
section.

### Image Slides with Vertical Thumbnails Navigation

![Desktop PDP Vertical Carousel](./assets/DesktopPDPVertical.jpg)

Here we have a Carousel with [Image](./VitalImage/) slides. Navigation between the slides is handled
via a vertical strip of thumbnails and two opposing arrow buttons.

This type of Carousel would be good for displaying Product Images on a Product Display Page (PDP).

### Image Slides with Horizontal Dot Indicators

![Mobile PDP Horizontal Carousel](./assets/MobilePDPHorizontal.jpg)

This Carousel, like the previous example, also uses [Image](./VitalImage/) slides. Here, horizontal
overflow is used to show a portion of the next slide (a _peek_ to indicate that there's more
content), and a row of dots serve as progress indicators, communicating how far into the slideshow
the user is.

This variation would be ideal for a mobile layout, especially when paired with using something like
the [previous example](#image-slides-with-vertical-thumbnails-navigation) as the corresponding
variation for the desktop layout.

## Content Editor Details

The Vital Carousel Component Edit UI allows you to add, move, and delete slides, as well as edit the
individual slides/components.

?> **Note:** By default, the Vital Carousel Component Edit UI doesn't allow you to edit (i.e.,
_swap_) the type of component used for the slides in the Carousel (e.g., Image, Card, Video, etc.);
in order to enable that, you will need to contact a Site Builder to make the necessary
[configuration](#configure-slide-component-type).

### Add a Carousel

?> **Note:** These instructions assume that a Site Builder has configured your site and/or page so
that you can add Vital Carousel Components via [Flow Containers](../../Components/FlowContainer/)
using the Edit UI.

To add a Vital Carousel Component to your page:

01. While in [Edit Mode](../../ContentEditorUserGuide/#edit-mode), select a [Flow
    Container](../../Components/FlowContainer/), and, within its context menu, under "Component,"
    click **Add** (or **Swap**, if you're replacing a component).
01. In the "Insert Component" modal, under "Type," check the "Carousel" checkbox, and select the
    Carousel variation you would like to add.
    - See details about the Vital Carousel variations under [Component
      Variations](#component-variations).
    - Hover over the "i" icon for information about a particular Carousel variation.

### Edit a Carousel

?> **Note:** Depending on how your site and/or page is configured, you may be able to edit Vital
Carousels that you, or another Content Editor, have [added](#add-a-carousel). However, you may only
be able to edit Carousels that have been added by a Site Builder.

As mentioned, a Vital Carousel displays a collection of components as sequential slides in a
slideshow; with this in mind, when editing a Carousel, you'll either be editing individual slides
(i.e., components) or the slideshow itself (i.e., adding, deleting, or removing slides).

?> **Note:** When selecting a Vital Carousel to make edits, you'll often want to select a specific
slide/component; to do this, you will have to use the Carousel's user navigation mechanism to bring
the desired slide into view, as there's no way to do so within the context menu.

#### Edit a Slide/Component

To edit a slide/component within a Vital Carousel:

01. While in [Edit Mode](../../ContentEditorUserGuide/#edit-mode), select the slide/component of a
    Vital Carousel you'd like to edit.
01. Once selected, you'll see the section for your selected component within the context menu, and
    you can then edit that component as you would normally.
    - For example, if your Carousel contains a collection of Images, selecting one will present an
      "Image" section within the context menu.  
      ![Carousel Context Menu](./assets/CarouselContextMenu.jpg ':size=50%')

#### Edit the Slideshow

To edit a Vital Carousel's slideshow itself:

01. While in [Edit Mode](../../ContentEditorUserGuide/#edit-mode), select the Vital Carousel you'd
    like to edit.
    - Depending on the action(s) you wish to take from the context menu in the next step, you'll
      actually want to select a specific slide.
01. Within the context menu, you'll see a "Slide" section, allowing you to configure the slideshow.  
    ![Slide Context Menu](./assets/SlideContextMenu.jpg ':size=50%')
    - **Move:** The left and right **Move** arrows will move the selected slide to the previous or
      next position in the slide sequence, respectively.
    - **Add:** Create a new slide (component) in the position _after_ the selected slide.
    - **Delete:** Remove the selected slide.

<!-- Inlining HTML to add multi-line info block with ordered list. -->
<div class="warn">
  <strong>Note:</strong> To add a new slide to the first position in the Carousel:

  01. Select the first slide, and **Add** a slide to the second position.
  01. With the first slide still selected, click the right **Move** arrow, moving the first slide to
      the second position and your newly added slide to the first.

</div>

## Site Builder Details

### Usage

See the API docs for more technical information on the Vital Carousel Component:
[`@bodiless/vital-carousel` API Documentation](../../Development/API/@bodiless/vital-carousel/README).

For examples of using the Vital Carousel, please see:

- [`packages/vital-demo/src/styleguide/Page/StyleGuideTemplate/Carousel.tsx`](https://github.com/johnsonandjohnson/Bodiless-JS/blob/main/packages/vital-demo/src/styleguide/Page/StyleGuideTemplate/Carousel.tsx ':target=_blank')
  - To see this page in action, run the Vital Demo Next site in `dev` mode, and go to
    <http://localhost:8000/styleguide/carousel/> in your browser.
    ```shell
    cd sites/vital-demo-next
    npm run dev
    ```

### Configure Slide Component Type

As a Site Builder, using tokens, you're able to configure the type of component used for the slides
within a Vital Carousel. There are two pre-configured types to choose from: [Images](./VitalImage/)
(`WithImageSlide`) and [Cards](./VitalCard/) (`WithCardSlide`).

Using these defaults as a jumping-off point, you can configure slides with whatever type your
Carousel requires by swapping out the `Title`.  
Take `WithCardSlide`, for example—

```js
const WithCardSlide = asVitalCarouselToken({
  Components: {
    Slider: withDesign({
      Title: on(CardClean)(
        vitalCard.Product,
        withNodeKey('card'),
      ),
    }),
  },
});
```

—using this as a template, you could configure a Vital Carousel token for YouTube video slides:

```js
const WithYouTubeVideoSlide = asVitalCarouselToken({
  Components: {
    Slider: withDesign({
      Title: on(YouTubeClean)(
        vitalYouTube.Default,
        withNodeKey('video'),
      ),
    }),
  },
});
```

You can get more complex with your configuration and allow Content Editors to choose the type of
slide component via the [Chameleon Component](../../Components/Chameleon).

### Responsive Tokens

As mentioned under the [Component Variations](#component-variations) section, some Vital Carousel
variations are better suited for particular responsive layouts (e.g., desktop, mobile). Knowing that
some Carousels variations are better suited for different devices, you can swap different variations
in and out depending on the responsive size.

To perform the swap between Carousel variations for different responsive sizes, we use the CSS
display/hide mechanism. This means that to responsively switch between Carousel variations for, say,
mobile and desktop layouts, there are, effectively, two Carousels on the page at once. Provided the
Images in your slides are reasonably sized, this should have a negligible impact on performance.
This method was chosen over the alternative — completely swapping the Carousel component when
switching between responsive layouts — because that method demonstrated a non-trivial performance
impact with noticeable UX lag.

Here is an example of configuring a Vital Carousel to switch between variations for responsive
layout triggers:

```tsx
// @TODO: Example pending...
```
